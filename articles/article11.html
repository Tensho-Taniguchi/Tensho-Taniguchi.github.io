	<h2>Dynamic Memory Allocation</h2>
	<p>Allow the program to allocate some variables (notably arrays), during
	the program, based on variables in program (dynamically)
	Previous example: ask the user how many numbers to read, then
	allocate array of appropriate size
	Idea: user has routines to request some amount of memory, the user
	then uses this memory, and returns it when they are done
	memory allocated in the Data Heap</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Memory Management Functions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>calloc - routine used to allocate arrays of memory</li>
		<li>malloc - routine used to allocate a single block of memory</li>
		<li>realloc - routine used to extend the amount of space allocated previously</li>
	</ul>
	<p>free - routine used to tell program a piece of memory no longer needed
	note: memory allocated dynamicall</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Releasing Memory (free)</h2>
	<p>prototype: void free(void *ptr)
	memory at location pointed to by ptr is released (so we
	could use it again in the future)
	program keeps track of each piece of memory allocated by
	where that memory starts
	if we free a piece of memory allocated with calloc, the
	entire array is freed (released)
	results are problematic if we pass as address to free an
	address of something that was not allocated dynamically
	(or has already been freed)</p>
	<br />
	<h2>free Example</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint">
float *nums;
int N;
printf(“Read how many numbers:”);
scanf(“%d”,&N);
nums = (float *) calloc(N, sizeof(float));
/* use array nums */
/* when done with nums: */
free(nums);
/* would be an error to say it again - free(nums) */
</pre>
	<br />
	<h2>The Importance of free</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint">
void problem() {
float *nums;
int N = 5;
nums = (float *) calloc(N, sizeof(float));
/* But no call to free with nums */
} /* problem ends */
</pre>
	<p>When function problem called, space for array of size N allocated, when
	function ends, variable nums goes away, but the space nums points at
	(the array of size N) does not (allocated on the heap) - furthermore,
	we have no way to figure out where it is)
	Problem called memory leakage</p>
